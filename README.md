This is a Windows tool to calibrate your .map files generated by TAC. the original .map files are has inaccurate latitude and longitude information (some offset).

So use this tool to calibrate them.

For example, after TAC generates an atlase and copy it to Blackberry, open the TrekBuddy? and load atlase, I found the GPS position is a little bit far from the right place.

When using this tool, remember the current GPS position (I call them ActualN and ActualE while N represents North latitude and E for East longitude) and move the cursor to the right position and remember the place's latitude and longitude (I call them MapN and MapE)

so the command line makes up to following: cb.exe 40D2M20.9 107D15M49.6 40D2M26.3 107D15M50.6 xxx.map

which D means Degree, M: Minute, and remain is seconds.
